# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Many students find it hard to remember important topics because traditional studying methods can feel repetitive and boring. Often there is no simple and interactive way to revise concepts. This project aims to solve this problem by creating a simple digital flashcard system that helps learners practice and remember information easily.

## Scope of the Project

This project focuses on developing a basic flashcard application using Python. It allows users to create flashcards, store them, and practice them using a quiz feature. The project works offline and is designed for learning purposes. It is limited to a command-line interface but can be upgraded later with more advanced features like a graphical interface or cloud storage.

## Target Users

The target users of this project are school and college students who want to improve their learning. It is also useful for beginners who are learning programming and for anyone who wants a simple tool to help with memorisation.

## High-Level Features

The main features of this project include:
- Creating flashcards with questions and answers
- Organising flashcards by subject
- Viewing all saved flashcards
- Practising with a quiz mode
- Getting instant feedback on answers
- Deleting flashcards when needed
- Saving all data using a JSON file
